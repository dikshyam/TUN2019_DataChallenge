	\item \textbf{Business Problem Statement}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
The United States is home to a significant number of military families, comprising of veterans, active-duty service members, spouses, and dependents. They are known to possess unique skill sets, experiences and leadership abilities, despite which, many struggle to find jobs and maintain these positions for long periods of time. The facts show that active services consist of 1,358,193, i.e., 0.4$\%$  of the US population. This works out to be the third largest active military army in the world as of 2018.
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
As per our research and understanding, the military equips their personnel in skill sets which are helpful to qualify for up to 962 civilian occupations. However, in spite of such training the veteran unemployment rate as of 2019 is estimated at 3.7$\%$ . This represents 6.26$\%$  of the US population from 2019. On a macro level, these ill-managed unemployment rates can lead to massive debts, homelessness, health risks and infertility for veterans and military spouses and can affect the civilian market with untimely demand and retention issues.
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
In an attempt to help rectify this problem, we intend to support Hire Heroes in accomplishing their mission by determining the relationship between a client’s demographic profile, \parbox{\linewidth}{amount of time spent working with individual clients(time to complete an assessment, time to complete resume, $\#$  of logged activities, etc.)}}\  and the time required for the veterans to get hired.
\end{justify}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item \textbf{Business Goal}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
Hire Heroes USA, a non-profit organization is trying to \parbox{\linewidth}{empower U.S. military members, veterans and military spouses by helping them succeed in the civilian workforce. }}Our business goal is to help HHUSA in its primary function by building a prediction model and identifying the most critical factors that are influencing a veteran to get hired. 
\end{justify}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item \textbf{Data Profile}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
The dataset was provided by Hire Heroes USA which uses Salesforce as their CRM. Out of the 13 datasets provided, we chose to use 3 datasets - Contacts (Demographic information of the client), Activities (activities the client participated in), and Hire Information. Hired/Not Hired was one of our derived variables; where 1 meant client was hired within 180 days and 0 meant client was not hired within 180 days.\par

	\item \textbf{Results}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
For our results, we utilized Rstudio, data integration, analysis, and modeling. Tableau and Excel were used for exploratory analysis and visualizations. On a high level, our results using Random Forest classifier has provided the best results after several levels of tuning. Due to the imbalance in data for the target variable, AUC was used as the measure for validating the performance and the final model has given 0.929 with accuracy 86.75$\%$ . In addition, we also used the survival analysis to understand the importance and significance of assigning specialists who were in charge of helping the clients through the hiring process.\par

\vspace{\baselineskip}
\setlength{\parskip}{15.0pt}
\begin{justify}
Although most U.S. veterans transition to civilian life successfully, securing employment and reintegrating into civilian communities, some veterans face transition challenges that can lead to or exacerbate mental and physical health problems. Emerging research from a survey conducted by Prudential indicates that difficulty transitioning to civilian life is largely attributable to employment. 
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
Hire Heroes USA as of February 1st, 2019 }announced reaching a milestone of 30,000 veterans hired into jobs since its inception. The national nonprofit is a leader in the veteran employment space, providing personalized job search assistance to transitioning US military members, veterans and military spouses(Hire Heroes USA, Feb 2019).\ But still as reported in January 2019, the veteran unemployment rate was  3.7$\%$  and Women Veterans Unemployment: 2.7$\%$ . With an increasing veteran and military spouse population, it is critical to find the right job and be employed. The non-profit organization Hire Heroes USA, mission is \parbox{\linewidth}{to empowers U.S. military members, veterans and military spouses to succeed in the civilian workforce and their vision is become the Nation’s preferred veteran employment service organization through a relentless focus on personalized career coaching that improves clients’ quality of life and strengthens the U.S. economy}}. }
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\parbox{\linewidth}{Veteran poverty also becomes a concern due to continuous unemployment and difficulty to fit in the civilian society.}} The veteran poverty rate for vets between 18 and 34 years old is higher than all other age groups. This group, of course, means that the veterans of the Gulf War and Afghanistan have higher poverty rates than other veterans. Veterans are also using food stamps in larger numbers than ever before. Although the rate is still lower than for non-veterans, it is rising at a much faster pace. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has seen an unprecedented rise in usage over the last six years, and veterans have been applying to the program to make ends meet. Almost a million households with veterans living in them receive SNAP.}
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\parbox{\linewidth}{Only 17 percent of employers say veterans are viewed as strategic assets in the workplace, according to the survey, released by the marketing firm Edelman(}}Natalie Gross, July 2018)}{\fontsize{13pt}{15.6pt}\selectfont  \par}. And despite the large majority of veteran respondents saying they have education beyond a high school diploma, 46 percent of employers believe veterans do not pursue a college degree or vocational training. Applying for civilian jobs may be challenging for veterans as they attempt to translate military qualifications, skills, and experiences to civilian jobs (Hall, Harrell, Bicksler, Stewart, $\&$  Fisher, 2014; Harrell $\&$  Berglass, 2014). Based on a study conducted by The Center for a New American Security where they interviewed 87 individuals from 69 different companies to determine why companies refrain from hiring veterans, to get an employer perspective they determined the gaps such as skill translation, Skill mismatch, Negative stereotypes and Acclimation(Lisa Nagorny and Dan Pick, 2019). }
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
\parbox{\linewidth}{Out of the several challenging questions that HHUSA raised, we felt that identifying the most important factors that impacts a veteran or spouse to get hired will help the organization the most since that is the primary objective of HHUSA. This analysis will help Hire Heroes analyse the importance of these gaps methodically and implement changes when supporting veterans. We are implementing data science techniques }}to determine the relationship between a client’s demographic profile,\parbox{\linewidth}{amount of time spent working with individual clients (time to complete an assessment, time to complete resume, $\#$  of logged activities, etc.)}} and the time required for the veterans to get hired. 
\end{justify}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item \textbf{Background }\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
\parbox{\linewidth}{A successful military veteran hiring program requires a strong foundation that runs much deeper than just getting the veterans recruited. It needs a phased-approach that begins with organizational planning and preparation to deploy the right applications, processes, and tools required to execute effectively and maximize business impact. However, most companies today do not have a clear picture of the number of veterans they already have employed, and lack of data on their current military workforce performance and the individual needs that may cause roadblocks for their military talent to reach full potential (by Jesse Canella, CEO – Military Talent Group and David Pollard, Chairman - PredictiveHR). Building the right strategy must first start with a comprehensive analysis and understanding of an organization’s current workforce and the overarching business objectives. }}
\end{justify}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
Usage of data analytics in job placement is an area that is getting a lot of focus recently though this is fairly new compared to the use of predictive modeling in other areas such as retail and financial industries. Many of the firms and colleges are working on coming up with different models that help their clients and students to have a successful career opportunity. The problem that we are trying to address has two dimensions. While we want to know what are the factors that are influential in making a client succeed in their job hunt, this problem also wants to understand how applicable these variables will be for the military professionals’ veterans and their spouses. There are a good number of studies that had happened on the former but predictive modeling or researches on the latter dimension seem to be very sparse. Similar predictive modeling that focuses on the successful career placement was conducted by Modern Education and Computer Science org (Ajay Kumar Pal, Saurabh Pal, July 2013)}{\fontsize{10pt}{12.0pt}\selectfont \textbf{ \par}}}. A classification model was developed to predict the likelihood of a candidate being successful in job placement. As per the analysis, the team tried out different options such as Naïve Bayesian Classification,Neural Networks(Multilayer Perceptron) and Decision Tree with k-fold cross-validation. Another study conducted at the University of Nebraska(\href{https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1172622.pdf}{\uline{reference}})\ used the Probit Regression model to predict the outcome of a successful placement. While the likelihood is predicted using different classification methods, we are interested in determining which qualities or activities get the veteran hired through HH U USA portal. A classification model would be ideal for the prediction of the likelihood of a veteran to be hired over other veterans in the database. This analysis will be utilised to determine which  military and post-military training and experiences were those veterans exposed to that assisted them in getting hired, can we replicate that experience by training the unemployed veterans.}
\end{justify}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
\parbox{\linewidth}{Predictive analytics technology can play a vital role in this base lining exercise providing, for the first time in many cases, visibility into the value and opportunities that a focus on military talent reveals. This data-driven approach is unique way for an Hire Heroes USA organization to accurately measure the growth of veterans and thus impacting on community as a whole. }}

{\fontsize{11pt}{13.2pt}\selectfont The entire data for the Teradata Data Challenge is provided by a non-profit partner, \href{http://www.hireheoresusa.org/}{Hire Heroes USA}, whose mission is to empower U.S. military members, veterans and military spouses to succeed in the civilian workforce. Hire Heroes USA uses Salesforce as their CRM, so most of their data is structured based on Salesforce's use of \href{https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/data_modeling/objects_intro}{Objects}. The data provided includes 13 spreadsheets, which we’ll be using to answer the following business questions:\par}

\end{itemize}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
{\fontsize{11pt}{13.2pt}\selectfont To answer our research question, we first try to solve what services that are offered by Hire Heroes are pertinent to this problem along with some latent qualities that the individual has. We started with accessing what are qualities in an individual which assist him in some way, to get hired quickly ( within 6 months of joining Hire Heroes)\par}\par

{\fontsize{11pt}{13.2pt}\selectfont Out of all the features given to us, we focused on 35 primary features ( - original features and - derived features) that we computed after further delving into the data and with help from Hire Heroes. Originally, we had over 300+ features, with 45$\%$  of missing data.\par}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
{\fontsize{11pt}{13.2pt}\selectfont For phase 1 of the project, we spent most of our time in data wrangling and feature selection, further reading on which can be found in the \textit{Data Section }of this report.

\textbf{Survival Analysis:}\ In Random Forest classification model, using the features from the dataset we predicted the binary outcome of Hired $\&$  Not Hired veterans. But it is also critical to determine those features that affect the time it takes for an individual to get hired. We use survival analysis to determine this effect. Survival analysis is used to analyze data in which the time until the event is of interest. The response is often referred to as a failure time(not hired) or event time(hired). In survival analysis we are identifying the difference in the rate at which a client is  getting hired within ‘n’ days for the different variables under consideration. \par

\vspace{\baselineskip}	\item Results $\&$  Discussions\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
Based on the above Table I, we can clearly see that the highest AUC is 92.9$\%$  and the lowest is 83.7$\%$ , along with the highest accuracy of 86.75$\%$ , and the lowest of 68.3$\%$ . This belongs to the Random Forest classifier with 10-fold cross validation, 120 trees and 5 variables for splitting at each tree node. An average of 19,620 instances out of 22,881 instances is found to be classified correctly with the highest score of 19,849 instances and lowest of 19,006 instances. Here our focus is on achieving the maximum True Positives, as we want to be able to predict how many people have been hired correctly. As this is a classification problem we choose the evaluation criteria to be area under the curve and our correct instance classifications instead of an accuracy measure.\par

 \par

Kappa statistic is a measure used to test interrater reliability, to distinguish between the collected data and its validity. Based on the kappa statistic criteria, the optimal model using Random Forest has a score of 0.69, which proves to be substantial for the accuracy of this classification problem(Mary L. McHugh, Oct 2012}). On average the Kappa statistic for our models was 0.67 ranging from highest score of 0.69 and lowest score of 0.62. This proves that the resulting models all performed substantially well in the interrater reliability.\par

 \par

\begin{justify}
The results obtained when compared to the paper studied by (A. K. Pal, and S. Pal, Nov 2013) actually prove to be doing a better job. The result from the study provided an accuracy of 86.15$\%$  while our results provide an accuracy of 86.75$\%$ . In spite of the accuracy being just slightly better, we can infer that our model is significant and possibly even better to the studies conducted in the related field. This is probably because we explored more complex algorithms while the paper only studies basic to medium algorithms.
\end{justify}\par

 \par

\begin{justify}
Using our final Random Forest model with an AUC of 92.9$\%$ , Boruta and Logistic Regression results, we can generate the two tables namely Table II and Table III shown in appendix, where Table II represents the topmost important features list with its impact and Table III shows the impact of demographic features on our classification. We use these to help us determine how to get a veteran hired quickly.
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
 
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
Based on Table II from appendix we observe that the most important features, which can be categorized into Active Participation, Specialist Consulting and Training Workshops. This is a significant finding as we can clearly see a direct correlation with the research question of determining if there is a relationship between the time spent with clients to how quickly they are hired. Spending time with clients here mean supporting them through trainings, providing consultation, and getting them to actively participate in various activities to stay on top of the industry standards like for resumes. We observe that the clients who have been actively participating in various activities, received consulting from specialists and have attended training workshops are more likely to be hired than those who did not.
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
 
\end{justify}\par

Table III from appendix shows us some interesting findings indicating that gender and disability play an important role in determining if a client is going to be hired in less than 180 days or not. We see that gender = male has a greater positive impact in getting a person hired in comparison to a person with gender = female. Similarly, a person with a disability of greater than 60$\%$  is less likely to be hired than a person without a disability. We can say that gender male consists of the majority class so the result from this would be inconclusive unless the data is balanced for male and females. Similarly, the disability greater than 60$\%$  is only taken into account after ignoring the majority Null class or interpreted as ‘Prefer not to answer’ class. These, even if significant in our logistic regression, did not prove to be amongst our topmost important features. Therefore, we need more evidence to be able to prove their impact, but our results do raise a flag that this is something that needs to be explored further to validate the findings observed.\par

 \par

\begin{justify}
We also found some insights from our survival analysis which definitely helps us answer our problem statement partly. The main takeaway from this analysis is that if a client was assigned a specialist who helped them through the transition process, then the chances of the client getting hired in less than 180 days in the civilian market was significantly higher. This factors into our recommendations as well and therefore, definitely is an important finding from a result point of view.
\end{justify}\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
	\item Conclusion\par


\vspace{\baselineskip}
\begin{justify}
After going through the entire process of cleaning and understanding our data and interpreting the results, we have concluded there are a few significant factors which influence a veteran’s employability in the civilian market. As a key highlight of our entire process, we explored the dataset provided by HHUSA to explore the relationship between the amount of time spent working with clients, their demographics and how quickly they are employed in the civilian job markets. On that basis, we built multiple classification algorithms and found the optimal result using Random Forest that predicts if a person will be hired in less than 180 days with an AUC of 92.9$\%$ .
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
With all these, we concluded that the most important features can be categorized into Active Participation, Specialist Consulting and Training Workshops and, these are the factors to be considered by Hire Heroes while looking at strategizing and understanding their client requirements better. Certain demographic features like Gender, Disability and Highest Level of Education show us some correlation but we need more supporting evidence to be able to validate this. Our current data suggests that these features could be skewed and therefore this could be a potential caveat to our model. However, ignoring these features could also result in potential decision-making errors and some extra validation techniques may be required to conclude with higher confidence.
\end{justify}\par

\begin{justify}
In response to our initial research question, we feel that we have successfully answered it and have been able to provide them with recommendations that could help them secure more funding to improve the quality of service currently provided. A few pointers that give a very high level understanding of our recommendations that we feel Hire Heroes should adopt are assigning transition specialists to assist clients in their tasks like resume tailoring, and hosting mock interviews which is the top request from clients, encourage clients to attend workshops conducted by HHUSA and encourage clients to be actively conducting activities like working on resume in order to stay on top of the industry standards. Lastly, more onsite opportunities could work to their advantage in comparison to virtually offered sessions. We feel all these recommendations could help a veteran get hired quickly in the civilian job market.
\end{justify}\par

However,\ as a caveat to our model, some high-level shortcomings would be that currently there is no framework to increase the correctness and completeness of data. In addition, certain  critical fields such as Rank, Employed Position, Skillset of hired veterans must be given importance and must be used to analyze and aid the unemployed veterans.\par

In the end, the most advantageous move for Hire Heroes would be, to leverage these recommendations and harness the power of these results to improve quality of talent hired, increase efficiency (quick reach to civilian market) and quality of the service they provide to their clients.\par
